  aboutpara: `
Over the past two years, I've immersed myself in the realm of web development, specializing in ReactJs and NodeJs with TypeScript. My expertise spans diverse UI/CSS libraries like Tailwind, Material UI, antd, and bootstrap, resulting in captivating user interfaces.

I seamlessly integrated Redux/react-query for integrating the frontEnd with the backEnd, employed testing tools like jest and vitest, and optimized form handling using react-hook-form and zod for data integrity.

I've also learned NextJs for server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing performance and SEO. I've even ventured into mobile development using Flutter, successfully launching MVPs.

On the backend, I've adeptly used NodeJs with express, NestJs, and AdonisJs, integrating SQL/NoSQL databases. I've also navigated CI/CD pipelines with GitLab and GitHub, ensuring seamless development and deployment.

In summary, my journey showcases a versatile developer skilled in crafting captivating and efficient web applications across the stack.
